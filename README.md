This encryption tool is for encrypting top secret, i.e. secrets of strategic importance to a country ( no objection if you use a cannon to shoot mosquitoes). It is the most powerful and strongest encryption tool in the world. Its strength is 10 to 154th power times that of the mainstream encryption: Aes256.
